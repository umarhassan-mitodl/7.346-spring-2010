Introduction to RNAi
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
{{< anchor "Anchor2" >}}{{< /anchor >}}We will introduce the basic properties of RNA interference by discussing a seminal study in the field. We will also explore how gene silencing can spread systemically between tissues in an organism.

Hints of the Future: The Discovery of miRNAs
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
{{< anchor "Anchor3" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Before the discovery of RNAi, there were examples in the literature of small RNAs, specifically microRNAs, regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally. We will discuss the earliest example of a miRNA and consider the general mechanism of miRNA target recognition.

Mechanisms: Dicing and Slicing
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
{{< anchor "Anchor4" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Small RNAs require proteins to carry out their important functions. We will discuss a few of the key catalytic enzymes in the RNAi pathway.

How miRNAs Relate to siRNAs
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
{{< anchor "Anchor5" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Most of the literature draws a clear distinction between endogenous miRNAs and synthetic siRNAs, but how different are they?

RNAi in the Lab I: shRNA, siRNA, and miRNA Mimics
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
{{< anchor "Anchor6" >}}{{< /anchor >}}In addition to playing important biological functions, the RNAi pathway can be exploited in the lab for experimental analysis of gene function. We will discuss the two main methods of gene knockdown by RNAi: the use of synthetic siRNAs and the use of expression constructs that supply cells with siRNA precursors _in vivo_.

RNAi in the Lab II: Screening for Hits
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
{{< anchor "Anchor7" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Historically, genetic screens have been restricted to organisms that can be mutated easily, one gene at a time, and analyzed individually for various phenotypes. Such organisms include baker's yeast (_S. cerevisiaie_), the fruit fly (_D. melanogaster_), and the worm (_C. elegans_). Now, RNAi provides the tools that allow thorough and systematic genetic screens using mammalian cell lines, thereby yielding novel drug targets in systems directly relevant to human disease.

RNAi Therapeutics I: Selecting Targets
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
{{< anchor "Anchor9" >}}{{< /anchor >}}The "off-target" effects of a drug cause unwanted side effects that can, if severe enough, limit the therapeutic utility of the drug. Such effects are also possible in the realm of RNAi, often as a consequence of the biological mechanism of action of these molecules.

RNAi Therapeutics II: The Importance of Chemistry
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
{{< anchor "Anchor10" >}}{{< /anchor >}}The needs of a cell _in vivo_ and the needs of a physician in the clinic are very different. We will discuss how we can improve on the chemical properties of siRNAs to make them more therapeutically useful.

RNAi Therapeutics III: Efficacy in Animals
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
{{< anchor "Anchor11" >}}{{< /anchor >}}If RNAi is to be used to treat patients, our studies need to go beyond _in vitro_ cell-based assays. We will discuss the efficacy of siRNAs in mouse models.

RNAi Therapeutics IV: Safety First
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
{{< anchor "Anchor12" >}}{{< /anchor >}}To "do no harm" is the credo of the physician. By treating organisms with synthetic siRNAs, we risk competing with normal endogenous small RNAs and possibly causing toxicity. We will discuss the various methods of gene silencing in organisms and the toxicity of each approach.

RNAi Therapeutics V: Delivery, Delivery, Delivery
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
{{< anchor "Anchor13" >}}{{< /anchor >}}A drug is useful only if it reaches its target. Small molecules, by virtue of their size and chemical properties, can distribute in a patient easily. In contrast, siRNAs are larger and highly charged, posing significant and unique challenges to delivery of these agents to the relevant tissue. We will discuss two strategies to overcome these obstacles.
